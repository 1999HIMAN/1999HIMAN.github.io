 Younger we were, we used to go to bed

 A story is what we have always wanted.

 A need created by our parents of course,

 For they get to explore their imagination a bit more.

 Passing on the myths and legends they know,

 Continuing the tradition of storytelling for sure.

 A thing close to our heart,

 As our parents tell us that part,

 Wild imaginations get narrated,

 With curiosity we listen to them,

 And we wonder how come everyday they have a story to tell.
