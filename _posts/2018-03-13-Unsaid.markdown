The truth you know, can't be said,

Cause you are not sure, if that will lead you anywhere.

The state in which you are, you think she might see it now.

Never to know what went wrong, you struggle to get there,

But things push you hard back to scratch,

Feelings that were expressed are at question now,

Was that all false, you wonder how?

Stream of emotions running down,

Things unsaid you cry out loud.
